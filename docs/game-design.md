# **Project: Ski Free Or Die!**

**Vision:** An 80s-themed downhill skiing game blending the technical precision of *SkiFree* with the vibrant, competitive "X-treme sports" energy of *California Games* (NES/C64).

## **1. Core Visual Aesthetic**

* **Style:** High-contrast 80s Pixel Art.
* **Palette:** "Windbreaker Colors"—Hot Pink, Electric Blue, Bright Yellow, Mint Green, and stark White snow.
* **Atmosphere:** Vibrant, sunny mountain resort. Chunky pixel-art pines, lodges, and spectators in neon gear.
* **HUD:** "Diegetic" 80s broadcast style. Blocky Commodore 64 fonts, scanline overlays, and neon-bordered UI elements.

## **2. Gameplay Modes (Phase 1 Focus)**

### **A. Weekly Time Trial (The "Stadium")**

* **Goal:** Pure speed and precision.
* **Fairness Mechanic:** **Deterministic Procedural Generation.** A single "Weekly Seed" is generated by the Go backend. Every player in the world plays the **exact same map**.
* **Rules:**
* Players must navigate through slalom gates.
* **Penalty:** Missing a gate adds a fixed **time penalty (+3 seconds)**.
* **Level Playing Field:** No power-ups or stat-boosts. Skill is the only variable.


* **Leaderboard:** Global and Local weekly rankings based on the seed.

### **B. Endless Descent (The "Roguelike Loop")**

* **Goal:** Survival and distance.
* **Mechanic:** A separate procedural algorithm that gets progressively harder.
* **Progression:** * **Upgrade Gates:** Players ski through specific gates to choose power-ups (e.g., *+10% Agility* vs. *+10% Max Speed*).
* **The Yeti:** A "closing wall" mechanic. If the player is too slow or stalls, the classic SkiFree Yeti emerges to end the run.
* **Meta-Progression:** Earn "Neon Shards" to buy permanent gear upgrades (Wax, Goggles, Suits) that apply **only** to this mode.



## **3. Technical Architecture**

* **Frontend:** **LÖVE (Love2D) with Lua** for physics-based movement and pixel-perfect rendering. Lightweight, cross-platform, and perfect for retro 2D games.
* **Backend:** **Go (Golang)** for high-performance seed distribution, leaderboard validation, and score security (Phase 2).
* **Input:** High-response "slippery" physics (inspired by SkiFree) adapted for modern keyboard controls.

## **4. Key Design Elements**

* **Momentum System:** Successful gate streaks increase a "Flow Multiplier," making the 80s synth-pop soundtrack more intense and colors more saturated.
* **Hazards:** * *Static:* Trees, rocks, and log cabin obstacles.
* *Dynamic:* Slow-patches (slush), jump ramps (California Games style tricks), and "Glitch" zones that invert controls.


* **Trick System:** Catching air on ramps allows for simple rotations (360s, backflips) to earn small speed boosts upon landing.

### **Next Steps for Design**

* **Physics Tuning:** Defining the "tuck" mechanic (crouching for speed vs. standing for turning).
* **Tile Design:** Mapping out the "Procedural Tiles" (The patterns of gates/trees the generator uses).
* **API Structure:** Defining the Go JSON response for the Weekly Seed.

**Would you like me to start drafting the specific "Tile Types" (the building blocks of your procedural maps) or dive into the "Trick System" logic for the California Games vibe?**
